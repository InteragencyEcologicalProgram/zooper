Description: This package downloads and integrates zooplankton datasets from the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. Datasets are manipulated into a consistent format and bound together, then differences in taxonomic resolution among datasets are resolved using one of two methods, depending on whether the user wishes to analyze community or taxa-specific trends.  Ancillary environmental data are retained in the final dataset. Users can also filter the dataset by a number of parameters.
