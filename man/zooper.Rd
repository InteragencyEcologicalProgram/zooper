\title{zooper: A package for integrating zooplankton datasets from the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta}
\description{
This package contains functions, lookup tables, and 2 built-in pre-combined datasets (one with the zooplankton data and another with the environmental data).

\section{Source datasets}{

\describe{
  \item{Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP)}{The EMP zooplankton survey is run by the California Department
       of Fish and Wildlife. Zooplankton were first collected in 1972. It samples monthly at 17 fixed stations,
       2 floating entrapment zone stations, and 3 stations in Carquinez Strait and San Pablo Bay that are only
       sampled during high outflow and low salinity conditions. EMP samples using micro (43 \eqn{\mu}m),
       meso (160 \eqn{\mu}m), and macro (505 \eqn{\mu}m) zooplankton nets. Note that additional Amphipod data with
       quality issues (e.g., vegetation in net) are available in the EMP data publication.
       \href{https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=522}{Data are available here.}}
  \item{20-mm Survey}{The 20-mm survey is run by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
       Zooplankton were first collected in 1995. Zooplankton are collected concurrently with fish
       samples at 41-55 fixed open-channel stations per year. Samples are collected twice per month
       between March and July. Only Mesozooplankton are collected with a 160 \eqn{\mu}m mesh net.
       \href{ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/Delta\%20Smelt}{Data are available here.}}
  \item{Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) and Summer Townet Survey (STN)}{The FMWT and STN are run by the
       California Department of Fish and Wildlife. FMWT samples are collected monthly between September
       and December from a subset of the 122 fixed open-channel stations. STN samples are collected
       monthly between June and August from 40 fixed open-channel stations. Macrozooplankton have been
       collected since 2007 with a 505 \eqn{\mu}m mesh net while mesozooplankton have been collected
       since 2005 with a 160 \eqn{\mu}m mesh net.
       \href{ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/TownetFallMidwaterTrawl/Zoopl_TownetFMWT}{Data are available here.}.
       Supplemental sampling from the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gate study data are also included
       and \href{ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/TownetFallMidwaterTrawl/Zooplankton_SMSCG}{those data can be found here.}}
  \item{Fish Restoration Program (FRP)}{FRP is run by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
       Zooplankton were first collected in 2015. Samples are collected monthly between March and December
       in shallow-water habitats near marshes. FRP samples with meso (150 \eqn{\mu}m) and macro (500 \eqn{\mu}m)
       zooplankton nets. \href{doi.org/10.6073/pasta/86810e72766ad19fccb1b9dd3955bdf8}{Data are available here.}}
  \item{Directed Outflow Project Lower Trophic Study (DOP)}{The Directed Outflow Project Lower Trophic Study
       is run by ICF for the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Zooplankton were first collected in fall 2017.
       Samples were collected once every two weeks in 2017 and weekly thereafter. Sampling is conducted in the fall
       and, starting in 2019, spring and summer seasons have also been sampled. Three sampling stations per region
       are randomly selected for 5 regions (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, Lower Sac. River, Cache Slough, Sac Ship Channel).
       In 2017, stations were sampled in 3 additional regions: West of the Benicia Bridge, Lower San Joaquin, and
       Upper Sac River. At each station, sample collection is attempted at both shoal (<=10 feet) and channel (>10 feet) habitat.
       Channels are sampled at the surface and, if deeper than 20 feet, also at the bottom 1/2 to 1/3 of the water column.
       DOP samples with meso (150 \eqn{\mu}m) and macro (500 \eqn{\mu}m) zooplankton nets.
       \href{https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/73b4acc0e1a72cb31d95ba96a4071fbc}{Data are available here.}}
  \item{Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP)}{YBFMP is run by the California Department of Water Resources.
       Zooplankton were first collected in 1999. Samples are from 2 sites, one in the Yolo Bypass and one in the Sacramento River.
       In 1999 and 2000, samples were collected for a couple of months each year, and then it increased to roughly winter/spring from 2001-2010.
       Since 2011, samples are collected twice monthly during most of the year, and weekly when the bypass is inundated.
       YBFMP samples with micro (50 \eqn{\mu}m) and meso (150 \eqn{\mu}m) zooplankton nets.
       \href{https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=494}{Data are available here.}}
