SizeClass	Meso	Meso zooplankton (primarily copepods and cladocerans) sampled with a 150-160 micrometer mesh net.
SizeClass	Micro	Micro zooplankton (primarily copepods and rotifers) sampled with a 43 micrometer mesh.
SizeClass	Macro	Macro zooplankton (primarily amphipids and mysids) sampled with a 500-505 micrometer mesh net.
Microcystis	2	low
Microcystis	1	absent
Microcystis	3	medium
Microcystis	4	high
Microcystis	5	very high
Undersampled	FALSE	This CPUE does NOT represent undersampling of a taxon. These represent good estimates of their concentration.
Undersampled	TRUE	This CPUE probably DOES represent undersampling of a taxon. This may not be a good estimate of the true concentration of this taxon in the environment from which this sample was collected.
AmphipodCode	A	valid
AmphipodCode	B	questionable [veg/algal bloom in net
AmphipodCode	C	not valid [error in lab]
AmphipodCode	D	suspect [possible missing data]
